                                was born in Darwin, Australia, as the third child
                                in
                                a
                                family of ten. My education was
                                entirely through homeschooling, and I viewed it as a series of levels in a game. The
                                faster I completed these levels, the faster I could progress through life. I quickly
                                realized that math was the most crucial subject, so I focused on accelerating
                                through
                                it. By the age of 15, I had completed Grade 12, two years ahead of schedule.
                                However, my
                                parents held me back for an additional year because I was too young for tertiary
                                education. During that year, I took twice as many subjects as required, including
                                advanced math, English, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and an elective.
                                Despite
                                being self-taught, I finished in the top six in my state.</p>

                                library included the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and I spent countless hours exploring its
                                volumes, fascinated by the world. This early exposure to a broad range of knowledge laid
                                the foundation for my future pursuits.</p>

                                From a young age, I was captivated by flight and the
                                freedom of birds. At 14, I earned a scholarship to fly, obtaining my Private Pilot's
                                Licence before I even had a driver's license. My goal was to fly the most advanced
                                aircraft in Australia, the F/A-18 Hornet, for the Royal Australian Air Force. Despite my
                                enthusiasm, I was deemed too young for pilot training and was sent to the Academy
                                instead. There, I studied Aeronautical Engineering and graduated top of my class.</p>

                                Pilot training in the Air Force was intense, with high
                                stress and a constant risk of being dropped from the course. My long-term goal was to
                                become a Test Pilot and potentially an Astronaut. However, my tendency to push the
                                aircraft to its limits and experiment with untrained maneuvers led to concerns from my
                                instructors. Although I excelled in the flying aspect, I was seen as risky and
                                uncontrollable. This led to my reassignment from fighter jets to a more stable role
                                flying maritime bombers, with a promise of returning to fighters if I conformed.
                                Ultimately, I found the environment incompatible with my ambitions and decided to leave
                                the Air Force after 11 years.</p>

                                dreams. I dived into the financial technology sector to learn about money, technology,
                                and human behavior. The first year was a deep exploration, peeling back layers to
                                understand the industry. Over the next four years, I faced pain, progress, iteration,
                                and discovery. Despite the hardships, I stayed true to my vision and eventually
                                succeeded, gaining financial independence.</p>

                                purpose. During this time, I discovered the effective accelerationism (e/acc) movement.
                                It resonated with me deeply, rekindling my motivation. I started engaging with the e/acc
