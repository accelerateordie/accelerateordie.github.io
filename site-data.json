My education was entirely through homeschooling, and I viewed it as a series of levels in a game. The faster I completed these levels, the faster I could progress through life. I quickly realized that math was the most crucial subject, so I focused on accelerating through it. By the age of 15, I had completed Grade 12, two years ahead of schedule. However, my parents held me back for an additional year because I was too young for tertiary education. During that year, I took twice as many subjects as required, including advanced math, English, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and an elective. Despite being self-taught, I finished in the top six in my state."

Being homeschooled meant that my education was my responsibility, with my mother providing regular assessments and guidance. Our home library included the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and I spent countless hours exploring its volumes, fascinated by the world. This early exposure to a broad range of knowledge laid the foundation for my future pursuits."

At 14, I earned a scholarship to fly, obtaining my Private Pilot's Licence before I even had a driver's license. My goal was to fly the most advanced aircraft in Australia, the F/A-18 Hornet, for the Royal Australian Air Force. Despite my enthusiasm, I was deemed too young for pilot training and was sent to the Academy instead. There, I studied Aeronautical Engineering and graduated top of my class."

My long-term goal was to become a Test Pilot and potentially an Astronaut. However, my tendency to push the aircraft to its limits and experiment with untrained maneuvers led to concerns from my instructors. Although I excelled in the flying aspect, I was seen as risky and uncontrollable. This led to my reassignment from fighter jets to a more stable role flying maritime bombers, with a promise of returning to fighters if I conformed. Ultimately, I found the environment incompatible with my ambitions and decided to leave the Air Force after 11 years."

I dived into the financial technology sector to learn about money, technology, and human behavior. The first year was a deep exploration, peeling back layers to understand the industry. Over the next four years, I faced pain, progress, iteration, and discovery. Despite the hardships, I stayed true to my vision and eventually succeeded, gaining financial independence."

I publicly committed to this cause, revealing my crypto identity and embracing my purpose. The support and enthusiasm I received reinforced my belief that I had found my destiny. Thus, ACCEL was born, with a mission to drive humanity forward through acceleration."
